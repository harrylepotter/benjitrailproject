# Covid Caller
Ferris Bueller meets quarintine zoom calls. Zone-out while your voice answers questions for you.

If you're on a conference call and perhaps not paying full attention, fire this up and put your phone next to your laptop. This transcribes the call. If your name gets called-out, it'll provide a bullshit pre-recorded answer on your behalf like "can you repeat the question?" while you try and get back up to speed with the conversation. It'll also fake a shoddy internet connection if you click on the "fuck it all" button.

I dont use this for work, and you shouldn't, either.



This is a 6 hour pet project from someone who hasn't written code in 5 years / has never used React/ still uses 'var' in JS / likes GWT / hasn't got a lot of patience. Don't expect much from it.
